<!-- Scroll-to-top button component.
     - data-scroll-top is used as a JS hook so scroll-to-top.js can
       find and wire this button without relying on a global id or
       mixing behavior into visual classes.
     - The icon SVG is included inline (via <include>) so the internal
       paths (.scroll-top__arrow / .scroll-top__pulse, etc.) can be
       styled and animated by the site's CSS.
